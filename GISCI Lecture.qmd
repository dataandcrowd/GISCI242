## What will we cover?

* Programming Basics
* Why is coding useful in GIS?
* Interactive lecture
  - Variables
  - Loops and conditions
  - Functions
  - Geopandas


## What is a computer?

```{r}
#| label: fig-myFirstFigure
#| fig-cap: A caption

knitr::include_graphics("Figs/computer-diagram.png")
```

* Components:
    - Devices (Monitor/keyboard)
    - Motherboard (connector)
    - CPU
    - RAM (temporary memory)
    - Storage (hard disk)


## What are computers <span style="color:blue;">good</span> at?
Given the definition above, it may be clear that computers are in some ways quite simple, and as a result there are certain tasks where computers excel. 

 

Tasks computers are good at include:

* well-defined tasks
* data storage and manipulation
* repetitive calculations
* processing data or instructions


## What are computers <span style="color:#A23F29;">bad</span> at?
:::: {.columns .incremental}

::: {.column width="50%"}
* Abstract or poorly defined tasks

```python
print("Python" > "R")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Tasks requiring impossible computing power (intractable tasks)

```python
## True Pi
3.14159265358979323846264338327


>>> from mpmath import mp
>>> mp.dps = 20    # set number of digits
>>> print(mp.pi)
3.1415926535897932385
```

## We need to be less poetic 
### and become more simplistic

### Logic gates

- `IF`: IF THIS, THEN THAT
- `AND`: IF THIS AND THAT TRUE
- `OR`: IF THIS OR THIS TRUE
- `NOT`: IF NOT ABOVE X



## Why coding is important in modern GIS?

::: {.panel-tabset}

## ArcGIS

```{r}
#knitr::include_graphics("Figs/Interpolation-IDW-ArcGIS-Pro.jpg")

```

## Programming

Example: `Python`

```{r}
#| out.width="200%"
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/iteration.png")
```

:::



## Why Python?
### Python is widely used

* Python being 1st in a row in programming ([TIOBE Rank](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/rank.png")
```

---

### Python is open
* Open as in
    - free of charge
    - as in access (download and run)
    - over time
    - not closed
    - reuse and change
    - any place (platform) and for everyone

---

### Python is approachable

* Modern interpreted languages (Python) â€“ Code is interpreted line-by-line via a programme
* Translating high-level human readable code to machine readable code
* Scripting
    - Only need snippets of code
    - Can perform jobs quickly
    - Ideal for GIS jobs

---

### Python is connected    

* Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software such as QGIS or ArcGIS now include a Python interpreter built in to the software
* Can customise solutions for your specific data analysis needs

## Interactive show and do with Python

What we will cover:

* Variables
* Loops and basic conditionals
* Functions
* Geopandas



## How will we cover it?

* Jupyter lab / Notebook
* <p><b><span style="color:blue;">Google Colab</span></b></p>
    - "Another" Free service provided by Google
    - Live code, text and graphics in one place
    - Compatible with multiple languages
    - Can build your own specialist 'environments'
