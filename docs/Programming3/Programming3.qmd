## Aim of today's Lecture
* A wee recap on Python programming
* What is web-mapping?
* Introduction to web mapping technologies
* How familiar are we with web maps
* Web map design and publishing: Can we build the model ourselves?



## Recap of Previous Lecture

* `Pandas`
    - Manipultating dfs
    - Grouping and Aggregation
    - Joining two dfs (or more)
* `Geopandas`
    - Plot
    - Import Attribute tables
    

## Let's have a look at Paris

## Population Density is Widely Used

::: {.incremental}
* Population density is a measurement of population per unit land area
* km^2^ and sqm^2^ are the most frequently used units.
* [List of population density around the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density)
* In your recent assignment
    - Area based in km^2^ : `merged_df.geometry.area / 10**6` 
    - Population divided by the area based in km^2^: Returns the population density in persons per km^2^

## Population over time




## Population change in maps

## Making multiethnic places

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

* **Urban Ethnic Distribution**: In major French cities, ethnic groups such as the Turkish population are unevenly distributed, with significant integration and interaction among groups, contrasting with more segregated patterns seen in American cities.
* **Ethnic Coexistence**: Unlike US-style ghettos, Parisian neighbourhoods exhibit a mosaic pattern of multi-ethnic cohabitation, where ethnic groups maintain distinct identities privately while publicly sharing space and cultural practices, fostering community cohesion.
* **Transnational Connections**: The ethnic diversity and vitality of neighbourhoods such as the *Goutte dâ€™Or* and *Belleville* are supported by strong transnational ties that enable residents to maintain and refresh their ethnic identities
